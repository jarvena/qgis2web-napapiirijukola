# qgis2web-napapiirijukola

This is a sample web app for investigating old map information released before [Napapiiri-Jukola](https://jukola.com/2021/).
The app is available at https://users.aalto.fi/~jarvena2/napapiirijukola/index.html

The app was created initially from QGIS-project using [qgis2web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/wiki)-plugin, and slightly edited before upload.
